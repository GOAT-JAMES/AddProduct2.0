# Custom Add Product Form project

This project will get practice using more TypeScript, form validation, and introduce custom classes.

The project will allow users to add videogames to a form. After submission, text will display to the user showing things such as the Title, Price, etc. 

The project will also use CSS to make a decent web page that is responsive to screen size.
